**GitHub Wrapped 2025** is a Next.js (app-dir) project that generates a year-in-review "wrapped" experience for any GitHub username — inspired by Spotify Wrapped 2025. The app fetches GitHub activity and presents highlights like top repositories, languages, commit streaks, seasonal activity, and a shareable image.

---

## ✅ Features

- Fetch GitHub user metrics (contributions, repos, languages, commit history)
- Visual summaries: top repos, top languages, monthly/seasonal breakdowns, streaks, percentile
- Client-side capture/export (uses `html2canvas`)
- Accesssdfghjkl;'
- ible UI built with Radix + Tailwind
- TypeScript and server-side data fetching with caching-friendly patterns

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (app directory)
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + Framer Motion + Recharts
- GitHub GraphQL API for data

---

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd github-wrapped
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Provide a GitHub token (required):

The app uses the GitHub GraphQL API. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment before running the app.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# PowerShell (Windows)
$Env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
```

4. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

5. Generate a wrapped page by visiting:

```
http://localhost:3000/wrap/<username>
# Example: http://localhost:3000/wrap/octocat
```

> The GraphQL client in `lib/github.ts` will throw an error if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is missing.

---

## 🛠️ Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — **required**: GitHub GraphQL token with appropriate public scopes
- (Optional) `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or `SITE_URL` — set your production base URL for canonical links, sitemaps, and sharing

---

## 📁 Key files

- `app/wrap/[username]/page.tsx` — Server route that renders the Wrapped view
- `app/wrap/wrap-page-client.tsx` — Client helpers (screenshot/export, interactions)
- `lib/github.ts` — GraphQL queries / data shaping (throws if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not present)
- `site.xml` — Simple sitemap (replace `https://your-domain.com` with production URL)

---

## 📦 Deployment

- Recommended: Vercel (automatic Next.js support)
- Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your deployment environment variables before deploying

---

## 💡 Notes

- Watch for GitHub API rate limits when making many requests; consider caching responses
- The screenshot/export feature uses `html2canvas`; cross-browser behavior may vary
